# Kamran Mackey's Personal Website

Welcome to the offical repository of my personal website. This repository contains any and all
source files used to built my website. However, please note that this repository is not under a
license, which means that by default, the materials listed in this website are copyrighted and
not modifiable by any other people. I have done this because a project such as this is incredibly
personal, and having outside members contribute to it wouldn't make any sense.

However, I very quickly decided thatit might be nice if users could at least inspect the website's
source publicly, without going through alternative means, like using Chrome / Microsoft Edge's Developer
Tools.
